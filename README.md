# âš¡ Hate Speech Detection ðŸ”¬

As any social media user might have experienced by now, it's becoming effortless to get likes, comments, and shares on
posts with divisive content due to the recommendation algorithms used in these applications. Increasingly, online hate
speech is leading to real-world harm, and these companies are struggling to identify hateful posts, with users & groups
altering their speech patterns online to avoid detection.

We propose building any applications with natural language user input in an Inclusive First approach with an easy-to-use
multilingual hate speech detector running in a production-ready and enterprise-grade environment. Our approach makes it
easier develop and deploy inclusive applications, without any cloud prerequisites, as a quick way to build any
distributed ML system. In this app, we will show you how to use this hate speech detector component within an
application & deploy it to Lightning.ai
